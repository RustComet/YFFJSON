    "name": "Scott Cook",
    "summary": "A roots balladeer with a rare personal warmth, Canada's Scott Cook has managed to distil the stories collected over years of near-incessant touring across Canada, the USA, Europe, Asia, and Australia into straight-talking, keenly observant verse. He's currently touring in support of his fifth DIY release, Go Long. All the hard miles notwithstanding, he still believes that songs can change your life, and your life can change the world.",
