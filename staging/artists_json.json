Starting in her then hometown of Geelong, she drove up the eastern coast of Australia and across the Top End, mostly camping at roadside stops and staying with friends along the way.\r\n\r\nHer two-year journey took her back to her roots in Darwin, where she stayed for nine months earning a living for the first time as a solo musician—writing songs, performing three to five shows a week, and crystallising her unique vocal style and stage presence. These songs formed the basis for her two solo CDs, Marisa Quigley and Gypsy’s Lament.\r\n\r\nSince 2015, she has performed with Her Sunday Best; four experienced musicians who complement her sublime songs with a full instrumental sound and soaring harmonies. Her Sunday Best are Rudi Katterl (lead guitar), Chris Mangan (keys), Darren Christie (who is now Marisa’s Husband)(bass), and Bryan ‘Rolie’ Dwyer (drums).",
