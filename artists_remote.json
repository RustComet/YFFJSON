The Geelong-based band has always squeezed out the sparks from the place where rock’n’roll collides with the spirit of Celtic folk. I have Irish and Scottish heritage through my grandparents on both sides and that was the kind of music I heard at home,” Keenan says. “As a little kid I listened to those traditional songs with my nan on an old record player. Then when I was discovering bands and heard The Pogues, it all made sense.” The ghosts of those who have come before are never too far away in the songs of The Go Set, and the album’s title tune is one of their finest on the topic. Dust off the dancing shoes and be ready.",
