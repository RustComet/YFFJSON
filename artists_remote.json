      "summary": "When a village with a population of less than 1000 can muster more than 120 to 150 voices to rehearse and perform together for the community's folk festival, it says something about the unique strength and community capacity in Yackandandah. This much loved group has put together a rousing and harmonious repertoire guaranteed to allow you to finish off the festival on a high. All credit to the wonderful choir and the energetic committee. An un-ticketed event; all are welcome to come and share the love as they lift spirits and lift the roof.",

The haunting tones of the Andean panpipes and a heartbeat of percussion create a swirling, syncopated, high energy chorus of sound, the sounds of the Inca realm. Dressed in bright ponchos, they weave in and out of crowds, twisting, turning, spinning – totally engaging audiences and bystanders alike! Some call it guerrilla music, some call it pop-up music. They bring joy and delight wherever they play.",
